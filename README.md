# Auditory In Autism
There are two main components to the study: pitch-deviant detection (low-level/early processing) and prosody-deviant detection (high-level/late processing). For both components, there is a behavioral and an EEG section.

Requires Psychtoolbox extension in MATLAB .

## Pitch Paradigms:
- ToneMatching.m - pitch discrimination paradigm. Stimuli generated in script
- SimpleTone.m - roving pitch MMN paradigm with an attention manipulation (3 pitches repeated 3 or 9 times before pitch change)

## Prosody Paradigms:
- Emo_id.m - prosody identification paradigm, repeated twice at two different sound levels.
- ComplexSound.m - roving prosody MMN paradigm with an attention manipulation. Only frustration and delight preseneted (x2 different voices; presented 3 or 6 times before speaker/prosody change)
- ProsodyStimuli.zip. - prosodic stimuli used
